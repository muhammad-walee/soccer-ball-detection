# ⚽ Deep Learning Soccer Ball Detection (DeepBall)

A computer vision project that detects and tracks a soccer ball in long-range match videos using a fully convolutional neural network.  
Built as part of my MSc project at London Metropolitan University.

> 🎯 Goal: Robust real-time detection of small, fast-moving objects under occlusion and motion blur.

## 📌 Problem

Detecting a soccer ball in long-range broadcast video is challenging because:
- The ball is very small (8–16 pixels)
- Motion blur when kicked
- Occlusions by players
- Similar colors to pitch lines and jerseys

Traditional methods fail in these cases — this project solves it using deep learning.

## 🧠 Solution

I developed a **Fully Convolutional Neural Network** that:
- Processes the full frame in one pass
- Produces a pixel-wise confidence map
- Uses multi-scale feature fusion (hypercolumns) for better localization
- Extracts the ball position from the peak confidence

## 🏗️ Architecture

- Convolution blocks for feature extraction
- Upsampling + concatenation of feature maps
- Final softmax layer → ball vs background confidence map

The network supports variable image sizes and avoids sliding-window inefficiency.
